## 1. What I Learned from Each Task

- Task 2: Practiced basic input, conditionals, and switch-case logic.
- Task 3: Improved string and array manipulation skills.
- Task 4: Understood inheritance, access modifiers, and static vs non-static.
- Task 5: Applied logic using loops and patterns.

## 2. Challenging Parts

- Task 4's inheritance structure and overriding methods needed careful planning.
- Handling string reversal while preserving order in Task 3 was tricky.

## 3. How I Tested My Code

- Used the main() method in each class.
- Printed results and manually checked outputs.

## 4. One Thing I Want to Improve

- Write more efficient and reusable helper methods for repeated tasks.
